								</div>
								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">In May of 2019, we noticed that the ceiling in our dining room was discolored. Fearing that the shower above the stain was leaking and having recently used Ingram Plumbing to install a tankless water system, we called them to investigate the problem. We liked the fact that the company was family owned and that it advertised as a Christian company. The eventual conclusion from them was that the shower pan would have to be removed and replaced.</p>

									<h2 style="font-size: 46px;" class="font-body t700">Insurance and remodeling</h2>
								</div>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">For the first step, a USAA inspector came out and estimated a cost of $6273.72 to demo and repair the shower, repair the shower subfloor, repair the ceiling in the dining room, and to repair the walls in the closet that were cut open to find the leak.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Since we had worked with Ingram Plumbing in the past and they were placing the work at around $10,000, we had them put in an estimate to the insurance company. That work was carried out by John Ingram. Their initial bid of roughly $10,000 had no specifics. They spoke with our insurance and the two of them agreed that the previous amount of $6273 was correct. Looking back, that should have been a massive red flag.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Having done some work myself in the past, I chose to use this as a chance to remodel the bathroom. I initially looked at doing the entire remodel myself, but Ingram Plumber informed me that a permit and inspections were required for the shower. Given this, we decided to hire them to fix the floor structure and build the shower structure. We were explicit in two things - that permits and inspections were mandatory and that the shower should be built to a point where the only remaining work left would be to put the tile on the walls.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">It should be reiterated that we explicitely stated that the shower should have the pan, mortar bed, threshold, and anything else needed with the only remaining item being the installation of the tile. It was not stated, but assumed that a moisture barrier and anything else needed for inspections would be done.</p>

									<h2 style="font-size: 46px;" class="font-body t700">The Contract</h2>
								</div>
								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">The contract drawn up by Ingram had 6 bullet points outlining the work with a payment schedule of 50% at start, 40% at completion of shower liner, 10% at inspection. Note that 10% of the fee depended upon completing inspections. The work was outlined as follows.</p>

								<ul class="lead" style="margin-left:60px">
									<li>Repair floor joists to support subfloor</li>
									<li>Move cold water line into wall</li>
									<li>Install new valve and trim furnished by owner</li>
									<li>New wood in wall to support new shower pan liner and new glass</li>
									<li>New shower pan with 24hr test</li>
									<li>Prep shower with backer board ready for tile work</li>
								</ul>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Note that the contract specifically calls out that repair to the joists is neeed and will be done. It notes the 24hr shower pan test. It also uses the phrase "ready for tile work" which we believe reflected our desire that the only remaining task be to install the tile. The contract was signed by Richard Ingram, the master plumber for the company and father of John Ingram.</p>

									<h2 style="font-size: 46px;" class="font-body t700">The Work</h2>
								</div>
								
								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Work was scheduled to start on Monday, June 24 and we were told that they would be done by Wednesday. We demolished the shower, bathroom floor, and vanities ourselves and I took the week of July 1-5 off work to do the flooring and other work necessary to put in new vanities.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">No one showed up on June 24th and 25th. This was blamed on rain. There was about 4 hours of work done on Wednesday the 26th and about 8 hours on Thursday the 27th.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">During this time, I expressed concern to John Ingram that the workers had put up backer board for the walls with no water and vapor barrier behind the backer board and with holes and large spaces within the boards.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">John Ingram then told me that he had never seen tar paper or any other barrier in a shower and that he was completely unaware of any such practice ever being carried out. I told him that I had worked in numerous houses and that I had never seen a shower without tar paper or some other barrier behind the wall - including the shower that previously existed in our house. He again repeated that he had never heard of “Red Guard,” “AquaDefense,” or any other topical moisture barrier system and that in all of his years of plumbing he had never seen or heard of a moisture barrier of any kind.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Mr Ingram's demeanor made it obvious that he was mocking me and he walked away. This was obviously a problem. From here on out, I watched the work being done much more closely. Mr Ingram remained adamant that the backer boards could not be removed at this point.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">No one showed up on Friday, June 28th. When I called to find out why, they simply said that their people were working other projects.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">I told the manager at the company that I had taken measures to complete the bathroom the following week and that he needed to do something to complete the work ASAP. John Ingram told me that people would be out first thing Monday and that it would be completed by Tuesday.</p>

								</div>
								
								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Four people showed up on Monday and worked until about noon. This included the master plumber, Richard Ingram. When they told me that they were finished, the shower was in the state given in the images below and available here and here.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">The dark area at the center of the shower floor is water. The board on the right is wedged into place to hold the backerboard that had been epoxied onto the inside of the threshold.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">When presented with this, I asked if this was the flood test and John Ingram told me that it was. I asked if this was how the code specified the test was to be run and he assured me that it was.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">I also asked if there was wood behind both walls to hold the frameless door and he told me that there absolutely was - despite the fact that I could clearly see there was wood in only one wall.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Four people showed up on Monday and worked until about noon. This included the master plumber, Richard Ingram. When they told me that they were finished, the shower was in the state given in the images below and available here and here.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">When the workers left for the day, I took a look at some of the backer boards that put in place for the walls. What I found was that there were numerous holes that were drilled at the bottom of the wall - some within an inch of the liner. All in all, there were seven holes drilled through the backer board and left in place with as much as ¼ of an inch between the boards. The pencils show the holes and the popsicle sticks show the spaces. In some areas, the gaps were big enough to hold two popsicle sticks stacked up.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Typically, when a shower is built, complete pieces are placed at the bottom and as the second piece. Since these boards are 3ft wide, this places one seam in the area being hit by water. In this case, the smallest piece was put at the bottom - meaning two seams are exposed to water. </p>

									<h2 style="font-size: 46px;" class="font-body t700">Refusing to pay</h2>
								</div>
								
								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">On Tuesday, John Ingram returned to retrieve the stopper for the flood test and get the remainder of his pay. When he did, I asked him again if the small amount of water in the pan was intended to be the flood test and if so, was this up to code. He assured me in no uncertain terms that this was a proper flood test. He also again assured me that there was wood behind both walls to hold the frameless door system.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">I confronted him with the fact that there should have been at least an inch of water in the pan for the flood test and that there were holes drilled far too low. His response was that they ran the flood test that way because I was in a hurry with no explanation as to what that meant. He also stated that while there were numerous holes drilled in the backer board below the allowable level, they did not go through the liner. He stated that the board had been drilled into other parts of the shower or upside down and then removed and replaced into that location.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">I pointed out that lying about the flood test coupled with the holes led me to believe that he knew that the liner had been punctured and that he didn’t run the test because he knew it would leak.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">At this point, he reasserted that the flood test was not properly run because we were in a hurry and he was trying to get it done in time to let us tile. He then asserted that everything (including the test) was done to code. I have no explanation for this.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">In my opinion, there were at least two reasons why Ingram Plumbing did not run the test properly. The first is that they knew the liner had been punctured by at least one of the holes. The second was that they had just epoxied backer board onto the threshold that day and submerging it in water would have ruined that epoxy and the board holding it in place. ( The board sitting on the right side of the shower was put in place to hold the backer board in place while it dried. ) </p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">After this, I again asked Ingram to run the flood test properly and they refused - stating that it would require them to remove the walls and threshold backer board and that this would cause them to lose money. I made this request no less than 3 separate times and was outright refused each time. They stated that they had already given us too good of a deal on the shower and would not do anything else.</p>

									<span class="before-heading font-secondary">"Tile Work" isn't Tile Work</span>
									<h2 style="font-size: 46px;" class="font-body t700">The Mortar Bed</h2>
								</div>


								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">When Ingram Plumbing presented us with the bill, I noted that the mortar bed had not been poured. At this time, John Ingram told us that he did not believe that this was part of the contract. He stated that the phrase “ready to tile” or “ready for tile work” was used by him and other plumbers to get the shower to a state where a tile worker comes in to pour the mortar bed and then tile.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">We explained that we understood that there may be a specific use for this term in industry, but that we were very explicit that pouring the pan and the mortar bed were the two things that we wanted done. We noted that if Ingram Plumbing did not intend to do the mortar bed, they should have stated that when we explicitly confirmed with them that this was to be done instead of just writing the contract in such a way as to avoid that work.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">John Ingram again stated that this was just a misunderstanding on our part and that he would not be doing any more work.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Again, we were explicit on multiple occasions that the pan, the mortar bed, and the inspections were the reasons for hiring a contractor to build the shower in the first place and that this was the work that we wanted to be done.</p>

									<h2 style="font-size: 46px;" class="font-body t700">The Walls, Threshold, and sloppy work</h2>
								</div>


								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">As can be seen in the images above, the threshold is made from 2x4s with the liner pulled over them and backer board epoxied onto the liner. This is not the correct way to build a threshold. Thresholds are made with a reinforced mesh that the mortar is poured over.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">The backer board walls built by Ingram Plumbing come down to the liner. The walls of the shower should not come down this far as they would place them in the poured mortar bed.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Cutting the walls this way and building the threshold out of backer board means that the walls and the threshold will create a channel between the pan liner and the mortar bed which always holds water. This water will creep up the walls and over the threshold to rot the 2x4s in the walls and the wood flooring under the threshold.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">While not deal breakers, there are a number of issues with the work that was done just being sloppy. One example is this space near the floor. It is one inch wide. Clearly, the board was cut wrong and the worker just decided to go with it. I guess that the idea was that someone would just fill it with mortar.</p>

									<h2 style="font-size: 46px;" class="font-body t700">Follow up discussions</h2>
								</div>


								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">John Ingram then made the offer to part ways with him keeping the first half of the money in exchange for not doing any more work and not coming back to perform a proper flood test. I told him that I would have to think about it as this still left me with no shower.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">On Monday, July 8, he contacted me again and demanded full payment. He refused to redo any work or to do any additional work, but offered to do a flood test the next day and to bring in a city inspector to witness the test the next day.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">During the conversation, John Ingram again blamed my schedule for the poor work and not running the test properly and then again simultaneously stated that he had run everything up to code. Both he and Master Plumber Richard Ingram agreed that code required them to run a flood test with inches of water in the pan and with an inspection, but then insisted that their work was up to code. More than 5 times during this conversation, John Ingram stated that the cost of the shower was already too low and that he simply could not do any more work or redo any work. When I explained to him that the best course of action was to take his offer to simply part ways, he told me that this previous offer was “rescinded”.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">At this point, I explained to John Ingram that because he repeatedly behaved in this manner, I did not wish to continue the conversation as I simply could not trust him at his word.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">After this, John Ingram told me that I was being unreasonable. He offered to come to the house, redo the flood test, apply a moisture barrier, and pour the mortar bed. I then stated that this was directly counter to his previous assertions that he was unable to do any more work or he would lose money. I stated that I was not inclined to believe the validity of an offer like that made by someone who had just withdrew an offer less than a minute prior. I also noted that less than a week before, John Ingram had told me that he had never heard of a moisture barrier and now he was asking me to let him install one. His response was that he had “educated himself” on the systems. </p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">I do not believe that this offer was made in good faith. It was only made after I told him that the company would not be allowed back onto the property due to their malfeasance. He only made the offer so that he could say that he made it and he had no intention of doing any work.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">I am now left with a pan that I paid more $2,800 to build which the builder refused to run a proper test on; and a walled in shower that has no inspection for the pipes or the flood test. I have to redo the work on the walls so that the mortar bed can be laid properly. I have to build the threshold properly and to replace the backer boards to remove the holes and the spaces. Hopefully, at that time I can confirm that there are, or are not, holes drilled through the liner.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Since this time, we have gotten estimates to redo the shower in compliance with code. Estimates to redo what Ingram Plumbing did have been less than $1,100 - 1/5 the amount they tried to charge us.</p>

In my understanding, this was the primary reason as to why the cost of the repair was so high as I would typically expect $6,000 to cover the complete rebuild of a shower - including tile.</p> 

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Had I known that no joist would be touched, I would not have accepted the contract.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">As seen in the images below, the molded joist that I expected to be addressed was left in place and the only work done was to replace a portion of the rotten floor. There is still water stained and rotted wood for 3 - 6 inches in each direction around the replaced section. I cannot say whether or not these joists needed to be repaired. What I can say is that John Ingram and the contract clearly stated that joist work was needed - so either needed work was not done, or the contract is deliberately misleading as to what was needed. This misleading amount of work was to justify the full amount of the insurance claim for a busted shower without actually having to rebuild a shower.</p>


								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">The first image shows the initial hole cut into the floor with two joists. The second image shows a closer view of the patched section of the floor.</p>

								</div>


								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">On Tuesday, July 9, I contacted the League City offices in an attempt to get an inspector to come to the house and look at the shower. At this time, I was informed that no permit existed for work at our house or at any address on our street through Ingram Plumbing. The inspector therefore refused to come out.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">The contract clearly states that the last 10% of the payment would be given when the inspections were carried out. Those inspections cannot be done without a permit and Ingram Plumbing never filed for one - yet asked for full payment without a permit or inspections in violation of the contract.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">As previously stated, when I refused to let Ingram Plumbing back into the house, John Ingram  offered to come out, run a flood test, and get an inspector in the same day. The permitting office for League City flatly told me that this was an almost impossible scenario and that it would likely take a day or two to get the permit processed and get an inspector out. This means that either Ingram Plumbing’s offer was just completely bogus or that they intended to bring someone other than the city inspector out.</p>

								</div>


								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">On July 2, John Ingram presented us with the final bill. It was for the full amount despite the fact that no inspections were carried out. It also denotes 48 hours were billed. 24 of those hours are for Mechanics and 24 for helpers. If this were true, it would be an hourly rate of $119.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">However, I work at home and was present for all work. A generous estimate of the work done at our house is still less than 30 man hours. This would be an hourly rate of $190 even if the work done had been done properly - which it was not. In addition to this, despite them telling us that they have built 70+ showers, that service isn’t even listed on their website.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">As noted previously, about half a day’s work was done on Wednesday the 26th or July, a full day’s work for the 27th, and then about 3.5 hours for roughly four people on Monday July 1st. This is a total or roughly 26 hours. Adding a few hours for people coming in and out would place this at 30 hours - meaning that the hours charged for this project was roughly 1.6 times the actual hours worked and even that was done at the absurd rate above.</p>

								</div>


								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">A complaint was filed with the Texas State Plumbing board. They stated that if the plumber failed to get permits and inspections, he will be fined as this is illegal. Additionally, since the inspections were included in the bill as something that we were being charged with despite the fact that no effort was made to complete this task, additional actions must be taken. This is still pending.</p>


								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">On September 11, 2019 on the advice of the plumbers board, we asked Ingram Plumbing for a refund. They refused. When I asked them to reconsider, John Ingram claimed that asking for a refund was "borderline harassment". Calling a customer at 9pm at night, blaming them for the failure to complete the work, and demanding payment is fine, but a text asking for a refund is harassment.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Complaints are also being filed with the attorney generals office and a lawsuit is being prepared / carried out.</p>

								<p style="color: #777;" class="lead">Despite the shower issues, I continued on with the remodel. I moved the plumbing for the drains, moved the wires for the lights, put down new backerboard, tiled the floor, put in the vanities, and put wainscoting on the tub before painting. While falling victim to this has set our bathroom back several months, it hasn't stopped us.</p>
